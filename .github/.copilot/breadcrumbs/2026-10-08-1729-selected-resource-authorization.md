# Enforce selected-resource authorization

**Date**: October 8, 2026 17:29 UTC
**Task**: Prevent placement and override APIs from using Fleet's controller permissions to access resources the requester could not access directly.

## Requirements

1. Enforce selected-resource authorization for ClusterResourcePlacement, ResourcePlacement, ClusterResourceOverride, and ResourceOverride create and update requests.
2. Build SubjectAccessReview requests from the admission request's complete user information: username, UID, groups, and extras.
3. Fail closed when resource resolution or authorization cannot be completed.
4. Require `get` for resources selected by name.
5. For CRP/RP label and all-of-kind selectors, require `list` in the relevant scope, without individual `get` checks for enumerated objects.
6. For namespace selection, authorize the Namespace selection using `get` by name or `list` for label/all-of-kind selection. For NamespaceWithResources, require `list` per eligible expanded namespaced resource type, without individual `get` checks for their objects.
7. Ignore resources that begin matching dynamic selectors after admission in this implementation.
8. Require `patch` for JSONPatch overrides and `delete` for Delete overrides.
9. Require Kubernetes RBAC privilege-protection checks when overrides affect Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, or ClusterRoleBinding resources.
10. For CRP/RP, authorize creates and reauthorize the complete selected set on spec-changing updates, even if selectors are unchanged. Overrides retain the original every-update reauthorization requirement.
11. For CRP/RP, skip selected-resource authorization on updates with semantically unchanged specs, including label, annotation, and finalizer changes regardless of deletion state. Preserve existing validation behavior. For overrides, retain the deletion/finalizer cleanup exception.
12. Enable enforcement by default and provide a temporary feature flag to disable it.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Authorization foundation and tests

- [x] Add a selected-resource reviewer that creates Kubernetes SubjectAccessReviews and preserves all admission user information.
- [x] Add RESTMapper-based conversion from selector GVKs to the plural GVRs required by SubjectAccessReview.
- [x] Deduplicate identical checks within one authorization batch and use bounded concurrency for object-level reviews.
- [x] Add unit tests for allowed, denied, no-opinion, API-error, timeout, identity-copying, and duplicate-review cases.
- **Success criterion:** Authorization behavior is independently testable and every unresolved or unsuccessful review fails closed.

### Phase 2a: ResourcePlacement authorization (current slice)

- [x] Build RP permission checks from selectors and REST mappings without fetching source objects.
- [x] Require `get` for named selections and `list` for label/all-of-kind selections in the RP namespace.
- [x] Authorize creates and spec-changing updates; preserve existing validation and deletion cleanup behavior.
- [x] Add RP constructor, scope, selector, overlapping-review, identity, denial, and failure tests.
- **Success criterion:** RP authorization is independently testable, fails closed, and does not require live object or informer dependencies.

### Phase 2b: ClusterResourcePlacement authorization (follow-up slice)

- [ ] Add direct cluster-scoped resource authorization.
- [ ] Resolve selected Namespaces using live hub API reads.
- [ ] Add NamespaceOnly, NamespaceWithResourceSelectors, and NamespaceWithResources authorization.
- [ ] Add CRP webhook tests for namespace modes, scope, overlapping selectors, and failure cases.
- **Success criterion:** CRP authorization follows the agreed get/list policy without expanding the RP-only review scope.

### Phase 3: Override authorization

- [ ] Authorize every currently selected CRO and RO target.
- [ ] Require `patch` for JSONPatch rules, including `remove` operations on fields, and `delete` when a Delete rule removes the entire selected resource from a member cluster.
- [ ] Apply or inspect override patches sufficiently to perform correct `escalate` checks for Role/ClusterRole rule changes and `bind` checks against the resulting RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding role reference.
- [ ] Add CRO and RO webhook tests for patch, delete, escalate, bind, namespaced scope, update reauthorization, and fail-closed behavior.
- **Success criterion:** Overrides cannot mutate, suppress, escalate, or bind selected RBAC resources beyond the requester's direct authority.

### Phase 4: Wiring, RBAC, and rollout

- [ ] Add a default-enabled hub-agent feature flag that can temporarily disable selected-resource authorization.
- [ ] Pass the RESTMapper, uncached/live resource reader, and SAR client into all four validating webhooks.
- [ ] Grant the hub-agent service account `create` on `authorization.k8s.io/subjectaccessreviews`.
- [ ] Update directly related Helm values and user-facing flag documentation.
- **Success criterion:** Default installations enforce authorization, while operators have an explicit temporary rollback switch.

### Phase 5: Verification

- [ ] Run formatting and focused authorization, webhook, and option tests.
- [ ] Run the smallest relevant integration tests using real Kubernetes RBAC authorization.
- [ ] Add focused RP webhook authorization wiring and update-gating coverage.
- [ ] Run `make reviewable` before submission.
- [ ] Update this breadcrumb with implementation details, changed files, and validation results.
- **Success criterion:** Focused and repository-required checks pass with no authorization bypass or unrelated behavior regression.

## Decisions

1. Cover all four v1beta1 APIs in separate reviewable slices: RP first, then CRP, CRO, and RO.
2. Dynamic resources that match after admission are an acknowledged limitation and are not blocked because dynamic selection is a core Fleet feature.
3. Placement label and all-of-kind selection requires `list` only. Named selection requires `get` for the named object.
4. NamespaceWithResources authorizes the Namespace selection and requires `list` for each relevant namespaced GVR, without individual `get` checks for enumerated objects.
5. Delete overrides require `delete`; JSONPatch overrides require `patch`.
6. CRP/RP creates and spec-changing updates authorize the complete selected set using the current requester's identity. Unchanged-spec updates skip selected-resource authorization but still undergo existing validation. Override updates retain every-update reauthorization.
7. Finalizer removal during deletion bypasses selected-resource authorization.
8. Enforcement is enabled by default behind a temporary disable flag.

## Non-goals

1. Continuous reauthorization when a new resource begins matching an existing dynamic selector.
2. Persisting creator identity for controller-time authorization.
3. Replacing Kubernetes RBAC or supporting label-restricted authorization policies beyond what SubjectAccessReview reports.

## Status

Plan approved by the user. Phase 1 and the Phase 2a RP-only slice are complete on
`feat/selected-resource-authorization-phase-2`. Phase 2b and Phases 3-5 remain.
On October 19, the user requested a smaller review scope. The full implementation
is preserved in pushed commit `e640d9b2`; the follow-up slice retains RP only.

## Phase 2a implementation details

- Added `ResourcePlacementAuthorizer` and `NewResourcePlacementAuthorizer` in
  `pkg/utils/authorization/placement.go`, with private mapper, reviewer, and
  eligibility-checker dependencies. No reader, informer, or Namespace resolution
  is needed. An explicit RP/CRP type switch routes RP to its typed resolver;
  the CRP branch returns a clear not-implemented error for the follow-up slice.
- Build get checks for named selectors and list checks for label/all-of-kind
  selectors in the RP namespace. No source objects are fetched. Reuse the Phase 1
  reviewer's identity preservation, deduplication, and bounded concurrency.
- Use explicit Allowed, Denied, and Indeterminate decisions. Denials take
  precedence over additional review errors; malformed results fail closed.
- Add an optional RP webhook authorizer through shared placement validation.
  Authorize creates and spec-changing updates only. Unchanged-spec updates still
  run existing validation, and the old invalid-placement deletion exception is
  unchanged. Authorizer unit tests cover scope, selectors, denials, and SAR errors;
  shared validator tests cover admission decision mapping. The dedicated RP
  webhook authorization test file was removed at the user's request; its wiring
  and update-gating coverage is deferred.
- Defer CRP authorization and its tests. Its handler passes nil to the shared
  authorization parameter, preserving existing behavior. The controller's resource
  selector resolver is unchanged.
- Production registration still does not inject the RP authorizer. Default-on
  enforcement, rollout wiring, and SAR RBAC remain Phase 4.

## Phase 2a validation

- Focused race tests passed for `pkg/utils/authorization`, `pkg/utils/validator`,
  `pkg/webhook/clusterresourceplacement`, and `pkg/webhook/resourceplacement`.
- Existing CRP webhook tests passed unchanged.
- `go vet` passed for the authorization, validator, and placement webhook packages.
- `go build ./cmd/hubagent/...` passed.
- Before committing, `make lint GOLANGCI_LINT=/home/weiweng/go/bin/golangci-lint`
  passed repository-wide with the installed repository-version linter (v2.13.2).
- Repository-configured lint passed with `--new-from-rev=main`,
  `--max-issues-per-linter=0`, and `--max-same-issues=0` for the affected packages.
  Unfiltered package lint also reports pre-existing issues in the CRP mutating
  webhook tests; these were not changed.
- `git diff --check` passed. Go commands use
  `MS_GOTOOLCHAIN_ALLOW_NON_LOCAL=1 GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, as in Phase 1.
- Full `make reviewable` and real Kubernetes RBAC integration remain Phase 5
  verification, before PR submission.

## Phase 1 implementation details

- Added `pkg/utils/authorization` with a reusable, stateless batch Reviewer.
- Preserved username, UID, groups, and deep-copied extras in every SubjectAccessReview.
- Added RESTMapper-based GVK-to-GVR conversion for correctly pluralized authorization attributes.
- Deduplicated identical attributes within each authorization batch; separate calls always perform fresh reviews.
- Limited concurrent SubjectAccessReviews per request, collected results in stable input order, and recorded explicit failures for reviews not submitted after request cancellation.
- Returned structured results that aggregate explicit denials separately from joined evaluation, API, and malformed-response errors; conclusive denials take precedence while errors remain available for logging.
- Added focused unit coverage for resource mapping, identity propagation, aggregated denial and error results, timeout handling, deduplication, and bounded concurrency.

## Phase 1 validation

- `MS_GOTOOLCHAIN_ALLOW_NON_LOCAL=1 GOTOOLCHAIN=auto go test -race ./pkg/utils/authorization` passed.
- `MS_GOTOOLCHAIN_ALLOW_NON_LOCAL=1 GOTOOLCHAIN=auto go vet ./pkg/utils/authorization` passed.
- Automatic toolchain selection was required because `go.mod` requires Go 1.26.6 while the installed local Microsoft Go toolchain is 1.26.5.
