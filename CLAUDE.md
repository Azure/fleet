# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

KubeFleet is a CNCF sandbox project that provides multi-cluster application management for Kubernetes. It uses a hub-and-spoke architecture with two main components:

- **Hub Agent**: Runs on the central hub cluster, manages placement decisions, scheduling, and cluster inventory
- **Member Agent**: Runs on each member cluster, applies workloads and reports cluster status

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Testing
```bash
# Build all binaries
make build

# Run specific agent binaries directly
make run-hubagent
make run-memberagent

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test

# Run unit tests only
make local-unit-test

# Run integration tests only  
make integration-test

# Run E2E tests
make e2e-tests

# Run custom E2E tests with labels
make e2e-tests-custom
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run linting (required before commits)
make lint

# Run full linting (slower but more thorough)
make lint-full

# Run static analysis
make staticcheck

# Format code
make fmt

# Run go vet
make vet

# Run all quality checks
make reviewable
```

### Code Generation
```bash
# Generate CRDs and manifests
make manifests

# Generate deep copy methods
make generate
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
# Set up test clusters (creates 3 member clusters by default)
make setup-clusters

# Run E2E tests with custom cluster count
make setup-clusters MEMBER_CLUSTER_COUNT=5

# Run parallel E2E tests (default - excludes custom tests)
make e2e-tests

# Collect logs after E2E tests
make collect-e2e-logs

# Clean up test clusters
make clean-e2e-tests
```

### Docker and Images
```bash
# Build and push all images
make push

# Build individual images
make docker-build-hub-agent
make docker-build-member-agent
make docker-build-refresh-token
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core API Types
- **ClusterResourcePlacement (CRP)**: Main API for placing cluster scoped resources across clusters with scheduling policies. If one namespace is selected, we will place everything in that namespace across clusters.
- **ResourcePlacement (RP)**: Main API for placing namespaced resources across clusters with scheduling policies.
- **MemberCluster**: Represents a member cluster with identity and heartbeat settings
- **ClusterResourceBinding**: Represents scheduling decisions binding cluster scoped resources to clusters
- **ResourceBinding**: Represents scheduling decisions binding resources to clusters
- **ClusterResourceSnapshot**: Immutable snapshot of cluster resource state for rollback and history
- **ResourceSnapshot**: Immutable snapshot of namespaced resource state for rollback and history
- **Work**: Contains manifests to be applied on member clusters
- **ClusterResourceSnapshot**: Immutable snapshots of resources to be placed
- **ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot**: Immutable snapshots of scheduling policies

### Key Controllers
- **ClusterResourcePlacement Controller** (`pkg/controllers/clusterresourceplacement/`): Manages CRP lifecycle
- **Scheduler** (`pkg/scheduler/`): Makes placement decisions using pluggable framework
- **Rollout Controller** (`pkg/controllers/rollout/`): Manages rollout the changes to all the clusters that a placement decision has been made for
- **WorkGenerator** (`pkg/controllers/workgenerator/`): Generates Work objects from bindings
- **WorkApplier** (`pkg/controllers/workapplier/`): Applies Work manifests on member clusters
- **Resource Placement Watchers**: Monitor and react to changes in placement decisions
- **ClusterResourceBinding Watcher** (`pkg/controllers/clusterresourcebindingwatcher/`): Watches binding changes
- **ClusterResourcePlacement Watcher** (`pkg/controllers/clusterresourceplacementwatcher/`): Watches placement changes

### Scheduler Framework
The scheduler uses a pluggable architecture similar to Kubernetes scheduler:
- **Filter plugins**: `clusteraffinity`, `tainttoleration`, `clustereligibility`
- **Score plugins**: `clusteraffinity`, `sameplacementaffinity`
- **Property-based scheduling**: Uses cluster properties (CPU, memory, cost) for decisions

### Placement Strategies
- **PickAll**: Place on all matching clusters
- **PickN**: Place on N highest-scoring clusters  
- **PickFixed**: Place on specific named clusters

## Development Notes

- Always run `make reviewable` before submitting PRs
- Follow [Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md) when possible
- Favor standard library over third-party libraries
- Controllers should be thoroughly tested with integration tests
- New scheduler plugins should implement both Filter and Score interfaces
- Use existing patterns from similar controllers when adding new functionality
- Property providers should implement the `PropertyProvider` interface
- PR titles must use prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `revert:`
- When creating new files, always add an empty line at the end

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Tests
- Avoid the use of ‘assert’ libraries.
- Controllers use `envtest` for integration testing with real etcd
- Mock external dependencies with `gomock`
- Unit test files: `<go_file>_test.go` in same directory
- Table-driven test style preferred
- Use cmp.Equal for equality comparison and cmp.Diff to obtain a human-readable diff between objects.
- Test outputs should output the actual value that the function returned before printing the value that was expected. A usual format for printing test outputs is “YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v”.
- If your function returns a struct, don’t write test code that performs an individual comparison for each field of the struct. Instead, construct the struct that you’re expecting your function to return, and compare in one shot using diffs or deep comparisons. The same rule applies to arrays and maps.
- If your struct needs to be compared for approximate equality or some other kind of semantic equality, or it contains fields that cannot be compared for equality (e.g. if one of the fields is an io.Reader), tweaking a cmp.Diff or cmp.Equal comparison with cmpopts options such as cmpopts.IgnoreInterfaces may meet your needs (example); otherwise, this technique just won’t work, so do whatever works.
- If your function returns multiple return values, you don’t need to wrap those in a struct before comparing them. Just compare the return values individually and print them.

### Integration Tests  
- Located in `test/integration/` and `test/scheduler/`
- Use Ginkgo/Gomega framework
- Tests run against real Kind clusters
- Files named: `<go_file>_integration_test.go`
- Separate test suites for different placement strategies

### E2E Tests
- Located in `test/e2e/`
- Use Ginkgo/Gomega framework  
- Test cross-controller interactions
- Use shared test manifests in `test/integration/manifests/`
- Run with `make e2e-tests` against 3 Kind clusters

### Test Coding Style
- Use `want` or `wanted` instead of `expect` or `expected` when creating the desired state
- Comments that are complete sentences should be capitalized and punctuated like standard English sentences. (As an exception, it is okay to begin a sentence with an uncapitalized identifier name if it is otherwise clear. Such cases are probably best done only at the beginning of a paragraph.)
- Comments that are sentence fragments have no such requirements for punctuation or capitalization.
- Documentation comments should always be complete sentences, and as such should always be capitalized and punctuated. Simple end-of-line comments (especially for struct fields) can be simple phrases that assume the field name is the subject.

## Key Patterns

### Controller Pattern
All controllers follow standard Kubernetes controller patterns:
- Reconcile functions with retry logic
- Status subresource updates
- Event recording for debugging

### Snapshot-based Versioning
- All policy changes create immutable snapshots
- Enables rollback and change tracking
- Snapshots stored as separate CRDs

### Property-based Scheduling
- Property providers collect cluster metrics
- Azure provider tracks VM costs and node properties
- Custom properties supported for scheduling decisions

### Multi-API Version Support
- v1alpha1 APIs maintained for backward compatibility  
- v1beta1 APIs are current stable version
- Feature flags control API version enablement

### Watcher Pattern
- Resource placement watchers monitor CRP and binding changes
- Event-driven architecture for responsive placement decisions
- Separate watchers for different resource types to enable focused reconciliation
