# KubeFleet Contributor Code of Conduct

> Important
>
> The KubeFleet project has adopted the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

As contributors, maintainers, and participants in the KubeFleet community, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who participate
or contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, attending conferences or events, or engaging in other
community or project activities.

We are committed to making participation in the KubeFleet community a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, level of experience,
family status, gender, gender identity and expression, marital status, military or veteran status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
tribe, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies:

* within the KubeFleet project and community spaces; and
* in other spaces when an individual KubeFleet community participant's words or actions are directed at or are about the KubeFleet project, the KubeFleet community, or another KubeFleet community participant in the context of a KubeFleet activity.

## Our standards

The KubeFleet Community is open, inclusive and respectful. Every member of our community has
the right to have their identity respected.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include but are not limited to:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include but are not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment in any form
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Violence, threatening violence, or encouraging others to engage in violent behavior
* Stalking or following someone without their consent
* Unwelcome physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual or romantic attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

The following behaviors are also prohibited:
* Providing knowingly false or misleading information in connection with a Code of Conduct investigation or otherwise intentionally tampering with an investigation.
* Retaliating against a person because they reported an incident or provided information about an incident as a witness.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and
consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing the KubeFleet project.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be temporarily or
permanently removed from the project team.

## Reporting

Report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviors in the KubeFleet community
to the project team at [kubefleet-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:kubefleet-maintainers@googlegroups.com).
All reports will be thoroughly reviewed and investigated, and a response will be prepared,
as appropriate.

For incidents that are not KubeFleet-specific, see the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
for instructions on where and how to submit reports.

## Enforcement

Upon review and investigation of a reported incident, the project maintainers
will determine what action is appropriate based on this Code of Conduct and its related documentation.

For information about which Code of Conduct incidents are handled by project leadership
which incidents are handled by the CNCF Code of Conduct Committee, and which incidents are
handled by the Linux Foundation (including its events team), see the CNCF
[Jurisdiction Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct/coc-committee-jurisdiction-policy.md).

## Amendments

The project maintainers may revise this Code of Conduct in consistence with the CNCF Charter and
the CNCF Code of Conduct.
