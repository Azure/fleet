KubeFleet is a sandbox project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF) that works on any Kubernetes cluster.
We are working towards the vision where we will eventually be able to treat each Kubernetes cluster as a [cattle](https://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/).

## What is KubeFleet?
KubeFleet contains a set of Kubernetes controllers and CRDs which provide an advanced cloud-native solution for multi-cluster application management.

Use KubeFleet to schedule workloads smartly, roll out changes progressively, and perform administrative tasks easily, across a group of Kubernetes clusters on any cloud or on-premises clusters.
