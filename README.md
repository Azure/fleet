Azure Fleet repo contains the code that the [Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/) service uses to provide multi-cluster workload scheduling and management capabilities. 

It follows the CNCF sandbox project [KubeFleet](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/) and most of the development is done in the [KubeFleet](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/).

## What is KubeFleet?
KubeFleet contains a set of Kubernetes controllers and CRDs which provide an advanced cloud-native solution for multi-cluster application management.

Use KubeFleet to schedule workloads smartly, roll out changes progressively, and perform administrative tasks easily, across a group of Kubernetes clusters on any cloud or on-premises clusters.
