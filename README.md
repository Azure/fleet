KubeFleet is a sandbox project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF) that works on any Kubernetes cluster.
We are working towards the vision where we will eventually be able to treat each Kubernetes cluster as a [cattle](https://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/).
