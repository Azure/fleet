	//   Note that this might lead to fields being overwritten on the member clusters, if they
	//   are specified in the hub cluster manifests.
	//
	// * IfNoDiff: with this action, Fleet will apply the hub cluster manifests to the member
	//   clusters if (and only if) pre-existing resources look the same as the hub cluster manifests.
	//
	//   This is a safer option as pre-existing resources that are inconsistent with the hub cluster
	//   manifests will not be overwritten; Fleet will ignore them until the inconsistencies
	//   are resolved properly: any change you make to the hub cluster manifests would not be
	//   applied, and if you delete the manifests or even the ClusterResourcePlacement itself
	//   from the hub cluster, these pre-existing resources would not be taken away.
	//
	//   Fleet will check for inconsistencies in accordance with the ComparisonOption setting. See also
	//   the comments on the ComparisonOption field for more information.
	//
	//   If a diff has been found in a field that is **managed** by Fleet (i.e., the field
	//   **is specified ** in the hub cluster manifest), consider one of the following actions:
	//   * set the field in the member cluster to be of the same value as that in the hub cluster
	//     manifest.
	//   * update the hub cluster manifest so that its field value matches with that in the member
	//     cluster.
	//   * switch to the Always action, which will allow Fleet to overwrite the field with the
	//     value in the hub cluster manifest.
	//
	//   If a diff has been found in a field that is **not managed** by Fleet (i.e., the field
	//   **is not specified** in the hub cluster manifest), consider one of the following actions:
	//   * remove the field from the member cluster.
	//   * update the hub cluster manifest so that the field is included in the hub cluster manifest.
	//
	//   If appropriate, you may also delete the object from the member cluster; Fleet will recreate
	//   it using the hub cluster manifest.
	//
	// * Never: with this action, Fleet will not apply a hub cluster manifest to the member
	//   clusters if there is a corresponding pre-existing resource. However, if a manifest
	//   has never been applied yet; or it has a corresponding resource which Fleet has assumed
	//   ownership, apply op will still be executed.
	//
	//   This is the safest option; one will have to remove the pre-existing resources (so that
	//   Fleet can re-create them) or switch to a different
	//   WhenToTakeOver option before Fleet starts processing the corresponding hub cluster
	//   manifests.
	//
	//   If you prefer Fleet stop processing all manifests, use this option along with the
