                      Allocatable represents the total allocatable resources of all the nodes on a member cluster.


                      A node's allocatable capacity is the amount of resource that can actually be used
                      for user workloads, i.e.,
                      allocatable capacity = total capacity - capacities reserved for the OS, kubelet, etc.
