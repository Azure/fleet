        description: AppliedWork represents an applied work on managed cluster that
          is placed on a managed cluster. An appliedwork links to a work on a hub
          recording resources deployed in the managed cluster. When the agent is removed
          from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster can delete appliedmanifestwork
          to remove resources deployed by the agent. The name of the appliedwork must
          be the same as {manifestwork name} The namespace of the appliedwork should
          be the same as the resource applied on the managed cluster.

                  in this slice is deleted when there is no mapped manifest in manifestwork.Spec
                  or by finalizer. The resource relating to the item will also be
                  removed from managed cluster. The deleted resource may still be
                  present until the finalizers for that resource are finished. However,
                  the resource will not be undeleted, so it can be removed from this
