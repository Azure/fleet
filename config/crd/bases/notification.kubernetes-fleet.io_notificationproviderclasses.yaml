                  retrying the delivery of some notifications; increasing this value, however, will not

                      If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.

                  StaleAfterMinutes is the period of time after which a notification is considered stale;
                  Fleet will stop (re-)trying the delivery of a stale notification, even if
                  the maximum number of delivery attempts has not been reached yet.


                  This is mostly helpful in cases where some delivery attempt objects are left in the system
                  without being cleaned up propoerly, e.g., due to disconnection between the Fleet agent and
                  the cluster.


                  Defaults to 60 minutes; the minimum and maximum values are 15 and 1440 minutes respectively.


                  Note that decreasing this value after the object's creation might lead Fleet to stop
                  (re-)trying the delivery of some notifications; increasing this value, however, will not
