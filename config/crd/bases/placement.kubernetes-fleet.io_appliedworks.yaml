          AppliedWork represents an applied work on managed cluster that is placed
          on a managed cluster. An appliedwork links to a work on a hub recording resources
          deployed in the managed cluster.
          When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster
          can delete appliedwork to remove resources deployed by the agent.
          The name of the appliedwork must be the same as {work name}
          The namespace of the appliedwork should be the same as the resource applied on
          the managed cluster.
