                    description: |-
                      Type is the apply strategy to use; it determines how Fleet applies manifests from the
                      hub cluster to a member cluster.


                      Available options are:


                      * ClientSideApply: Fleet uses three-way merge to apply manifests, similar to how kubectl
                        performs a client-side apply. This is the default option.


                        Note that this strategy requires that Fleet keep the last applied configuration in the
                        annoation of an applied resource. If the object gets so large that apply ops can no longer
                        be executed, Fleet will switch to server-side apply.


                      * ServerSideApply: Fleet uses server-side apply to apply manifests; Fleet itself will
                        become the field manager for specified fields in the manifests. Specify
                        ServerSideApplyConfig as appropriate if you would like Fleet to take over field
                        ownership upon conflicts. This is the recommended option for most scenarios; it might
                        help reduce object size and safely resolve conflicts between field values. For more
                        information, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation
                        (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#comparison-with-client-side-apply).


                      * ReportApplyDiff: Fleet uses server-side apply to apply manifests, and will report
                        that an object has drifted from its desired state if (and only if) fields managed by Fleet
                        have been overwritten by another agent (i.e., the field values have deviated from the
                        desired ones kept in the hub cluster). This is helpful in drift detection scenarios, where
                        you would like to make sure that no one should manipulate the placed objects in the member
                        clusters directly without going through the Fleet hub cluster.


                        To fix the drifts, you may:
                        * Revert the changes made to the affected objects in the member cluster; or
                        * Update the desired state in the hub cluster and let Fleet apply the latest manifests,
                          ideally it should overwrite the drifted fields; or
                        * Switch to the ServerSideApply strategy, which will trigger Fleet to reapply the current
                          manifest revision and overwrite the drifted fields.


                        Note that with this strategy, Fleet will not attempt to detect changes in fields that
                        are not managed by Fleet: if an agent adds/edits a field that are absent in the hub
                        cluster manifest, it will not be considered as a drift. As an exception, Fleet will
                        always check for inconsistencies in the object labels and annoations, that is, editing
                        the labels/annotations in a placed object will always trigger the drift detection, even
                        if the affected label/annotation key is absent in the hub cluster manifest.


                      * ReportAnyDiff: Fleet uses server-side apply to apply manifests, and will report that
                        an object has drifted from its desired state if any field has been added, removed, or
                        edited by another agent, even if the field itself is not managed by Fleet. This is mostly
                        helpful if you would like to guard against drifts and make sure that objects are
                        exactly the same between the hub cluster and the member clusters.


                        To fix the drifts, you may:
                        * Revert the edits made to the affected objects in the member cluster; or
                        * Update the desired state in the hub cluster, which should include all the affected fields,
                          and let Fleet apply the latest manifests.


                        Please note that with this strategy, it is recommended that you:
                        * Specify all the fields of interest explicitly (even if you are OK with using the
                          default values) in the hub cluster manifests; and
                        * Make sure that no fields are managed by agents other than Fleet, such as HPAs, VPAs,
                          custom controllers, etc.


                      For a comparison between the different strategies and some examples, please refer to the
