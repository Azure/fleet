                    description: |-
                      ComparisonOption controls how Fleet compares the desired state of a resource, as kept in
                      a hub cluster manifest, with the current state of the resource (if applicable) in the
                      member cluster.


                      Available options are:


                      * PartialComparison: with this option, Fleet will compare only fields that are managed by
                        Fleet, i.e., the fields that are specified explicitly in the hub cluster manifest.
                        Unmanaged fields are ignored. This is the default option.


                      * FullComparison: with this option, Fleet will compare all fields of the resource,
                        even if the fields are absent from the hub cluster manifest.


                      Consider using the PartialComparison option if you would like to:


                      * use the default values for certain fields; or
                      * let another agent, e.g., HPAs, VPAs, etc., on the member cluster side manage some fields; or
                      * allow ad-hoc or cluster-specific settings on the member cluster side.


                      To use the FullComparison option, it is recommended that you:


                      * specify all fields as appropriate in the hub cluster, even if you are OK with using default
                        values;
                      * make sure that no fields are managed by agents other than Fleet on the member cluster
                        side, such as HPAs, VPAs, or other controllers.


                      See the Fleet documentation for further explanations and usage examples.

                      Type is the apply strategy to use; it determines how Fleet applies manifests from the
                      hub cluster to a member cluster.


                      Available options are:


                      * ClientSideApply: Fleet uses three-way merge to apply manifests, similar to how kubectl
                        performs a client-side apply. This is the default option.


                        Note that this strategy requires that Fleet keep the last applied configuration in the
                        annotation of an applied resource. If the object gets so large that apply ops can no longer
                        be executed, Fleet will switch to server-side apply.


                        Use ComparisonOption and WhenToApply settings to control when an apply op can be executed.


                      * ServerSideApply: Fleet uses server-side apply to apply manifests; Fleet itself will
                        become the field manager for specified fields in the manifests. Specify
                        ServerSideApplyConfig as appropriate if you would like Fleet to take over field
                        ownership upon conflicts. This is the recommended option for most scenarios; it might
                        help reduce object size and safely resolve conflicts between field values. For more
                        information, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation
                        (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#comparison-with-client-side-apply).


                        Use ComparisonOption and WhenToApply settings to control when an apply op can be executed.


                      * ReportDiff: Fleet will compare the desired state of a resource as kept in the hub cluster
                        with its current state (if applicable) on the member cluster side, and report any
                        differences. No actual apply ops would be executed, and resources will be left alone as they
                        are on the member clusters.


                        Use ComparisonOption setting to control how the difference is calculated.


                      For a comparison between the different strategies and usage examples, refer to the
                      Fleet documentation.

                    description: |-
                      WhenToApply controls when Fleet would apply the manifests on the hub cluster to the member
                      clusters.


                      Available options are:


                      * Always: with this option, Fleet will periodically apply hub cluster manifests
                        on the member cluster side; this will effectively overwrite any change in the fields
                        managed by Fleet (i.e., specified in the hub cluster manifest). This is the default
                        option.


                        Note that this option would revert any ad-hoc changes made on the member cluster side in
                        the managed fields; if you would like to make temporary edits on the member cluster side
                        in the managed fields, switch to IfNotDrifted option. Note that changes in unmanaged
                        fields will be left alone; if you use the FullDiff compare option, such changes will
                        be reported as drifts.


                      * IfNotDrifted: with this option, Fleet will stop applying hub cluster manifests on
                        clusters that have drifted from the desired state; apply ops would still continue on
                        the rest of the clusters. Drifts are calculated using the ComparisonOption,
                        as explained in the corresponding field.


                        Use this option if you would like Fleet to detect drifts in your multi-cluster setup.
                        A drift occurs when an agent makes an ad-hoc change on the member cluster side that
                        makes affected resources deviate from its desired state as kept in the hub cluster;
                        and this option grants you an opportunity to view the drift details and take actions
                        accordingly. The drift details will be reported in the CRP status.


                        To fix a drift, you may:


                        * revert the changes manually on the member cluster side
                        * update the hub cluster manifest; this will trigger Fleet to apply the latest revision
                          of the manifests, which will overwrite the drifted fields
                          (if they are managed by Fleet)
                        * switch to the Always option; this will trigger Fleet to apply the current revision
                          of the manifests, which will overwrite the drifted fields (if they are managed by Fleet).
                        * if applicable and necessary, delete the drifted resources on the member cluster side; Fleet
                          will attempt to re-create them using the hub cluster manifests
                    enum:
                    - Always
                    - IfNotDrifted
                    type: string
                  whenToTakeOver:
                    default: Always
                    description: |-
                      WhenToTakeOver determines the action to take when Fleet applies resources to a member
                      cluster for the first time and finds out that the resource already exists in the cluster.


                      This setting is most relevant in cases where you would like Fleet to manage pre-existing
                      resources on a member cluster.


                      Available options include:


                      * Always: with this action, Fleet will apply the hub cluster manifests to the member
                        clusters even if the affected resources already exist. This is the default action.


                        Note that this might lead to fields being overwritten on the member clusters, if they
                        are specified in the hub cluster manifests.


                      * IfNoDiff: with this action, Fleet will apply the hub cluster manifests to the member
                        clusters if (and only if) pre-existing resources look the same as the hub cluster manifests.
                        This is a safer option as pre-existing resources that are inconsistent with the hub cluster
                        manifests will not be overwritten; in fact, Fleet will ignore them until the inconsistencies
                        are resolved properly: any change you make to the hub cluster manifests would not be
                        applied, and if you delete the manifests or even the ClusterResourcePlacement itself
                        from the hub cluster, these pre-existing resources would not be taken away.


                        Fleet will check for inconsistencies in accordance with the ComparisonOption setting. See also
                        the comments on the ComparisonOption field for more information.


                        If a diff has been found in a field that is **managed** by Fleet (i.e., the field
                        **is specified ** in the hub cluster manifest), consider one of the following actions:
                        * set the field in the member cluster to be of the same value as that in the hub cluster
                          manifest.
