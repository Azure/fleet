          ClusterResourceOverrideSnapshot is used to store a snapshot of ClusterResourceOverride.
          Its spec is immutable.
          We assign an ever-increasing index for snapshots.
          The naming convention of a ClusterResourceOverrideSnapshot is {ClusterResourceOverride}-{resourceIndex}.
          resourceIndex will begin with 0.
          Each snapshot MUST have the following labels:
            - `OverrideTrackingLabel` which points to its owner ClusterResourceOverride.
            - `IsLatestSnapshotLabel` which indicates whether the snapshot is the latest one.

                                          PropertySelector is a property query over all joined member clusters. Clusters matching
                                          the query are selected.


                                          If you specify both label and property selectors in the same term, the results are AND'd.
