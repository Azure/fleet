        description: "OverriddenClusterResource is used to store the result of cluster
          scoped resources after overridden on the target cluster. Once the snapshot
          has been overridden by the system, the manifest won't be updated because
          of the cluster label change (e.g the override rules are not apply to the
          target cluster anymore). To make the changes effective, you need to update
          the resource or its related override. \n Its spec is immutable. We may need
          to produce more than one overriddenClusterResource for all the resources
          a placement selected to get around the 1MB size limit of k8s objects. The
          naming convention of a overriddenClusterResourceSnapshot is {clusterResourceSnapshotName}-{targetCluster}-{random-suffix}.
          Each snapshot MUST have the following labels: - `CRPTrackingLabel` which
          points to its owner CRP. - `TargetClusterLabel` which points where to place
          the overridden resources."
