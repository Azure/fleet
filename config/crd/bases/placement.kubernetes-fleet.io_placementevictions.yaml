          PlacementEviction is an eviction attempt on a specific placement from
          a ClusterResourcePlacement object; one may use this API to force the removal of specific
          resources from a cluster.


          An eviction is a voluntary disruption; its execution is subject to the disruption budget
          linked with the target ClusterResourcePlacement object (if present).


          Beware that an eviction alone does not guarantee that a placement will not re-appear; i.e.,
          after an eviction, the Fleet scheduler might still pick the previous target cluster for
          placement. To prevent this, considering adding proper taints to the target cluster before running
          an eviction that will exclude it from future placements; this is especially true in scenarios
          where one would like to perform a cluster replacement.


          For safety reasons, Fleet will only execute an eviction once; the spec in this object is immutable,
          and once executed, the object will be ignored after. To trigger another eviction attempt on the
          same placement from the same ClusterResourcePlacement object, one must re-create (delete and
          create) the same Eviction object. Note also that an Eviction object will be
          ignored once it is deemed invalid (e.g., such an object might be targeting a CRP object or
          a placement that does not exist yet), even if it does become valid later
          (e.g., the CRP object or the placement appears later). To fix the situation, re-create the
          Eviction object.


          Executed evictions might be kept around for a while for auditing purposes; the Fleet controllers might
          have a TTL set up for such objects and will garbage collect them automatically. For further
          information, see the Fleet documentation.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
