          StagedUpdateRun defines a stage by stage update run that applies the selected resources by the
          corresponding ClusterResourcePlacement to its selected clusters. We remove the resources from the clusters that are
          unselected after all the stages explicitly defined in the updateStrategy complete.
          Each StagedUpdateRun object corresponds to a single "release" of a certain version of the resources.
          The release is abandoned if the StagedUpdateRun object is deleted or the scheduling decision (i.e., the selected clusters) changes.
          The name of the StagedUpdateRun needs to conform to [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).
