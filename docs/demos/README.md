Explore our demo section for hands-on examples of integrating Fleet to streamline application deployment and management across your multi-cluster environment.

* [Fleet and ArgoCD Integration](./ArgoCD/fleet-argocd-integration.md)   
  See Fleet and ArgoCD working together to efficiently manage Kubernetes resources across your fleet of clusters. This demonstration showcases how to:
  - Target specific clusters for ArgoCD `Application` deployment using `ClusterResourcePlacement`.
  - Customize configurations for different environments with `ResourceOverride`.
  - Implement controlled, safe rollouts of `Applications` through `ClusterStagedUpdateRun`.
