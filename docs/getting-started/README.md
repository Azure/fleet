# Fleet Getting Started Tutorials

This documentation provides a number of tutorials which can help you get started with Fleet,
the open-source multi-cluster management solution, developed by Microsoft Azure;
through them, you will learn about the setup of Fleet and its core functionalities.

> Note
>
> All tutorials listed assume that you already have a basic understanding of Kubernetes. For more
> information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

Fleet can work with many different Kubernetes environment setups. You may run Fleet on managed
Kubernetes clusters, such as
[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service)
or on on-premises Kubernetes clusters. It even works with local [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
clusters, for experimental purposes. Pick a tutorial that is most appropriate for your
setup from the options below; through Fleet offers the same set of functionalities
regardless of the setup environment, the actual setup process might be different across
environments.

* If you are familar with Microsoft Azure, or if you currently do not have a Kubernetes setup
that you can run Fleet with, use the
[Getting started with Fleet using Azure Fleet Manager](aks-fleet-manager.md) tutorial.

    It is also a perfect option if you do not know which tutorial to begin with.
