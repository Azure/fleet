# Fleet Getting Started Tutorials

The Fleet documentation provides a variety of getting-started tutorials that help you try out
Fleet in environments that you are most familiar with; see the list below for more 
information.

## Using kind clusters

[Getting started with Fleet using kind clusters](./kind.md) is a tutorial that helps set up
Fleet with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) clusters; these are Kubernetes clusters running
on a local machine via [Docker](https://docker.com) containers. This setup is the easiest way
to get started with Fleet, with very little overhead; it is strongly recommended if you do
not have any Kubernetes clusters available for testing purposes on hand.

## Using on-premises clusters

[Getting started with Fleet using on-premises clusters](./on-prem.md) is a tutorial that helps
set up Fleet with existing on-premises Kubernetes clusters. If you are familiar with Kubernetes
administrative tasks and are evaluating Fleet as the multi-cluster management solution for your
on-premises clusters, consider starting with this tutorial.
