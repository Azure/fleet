# How can I debug when my CRP status is ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled condition status is set to false?
The `ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled` condition is set to `false` when the scheduler cannot find all the clusters needed as specified by the scheduling policy.
> Note: In addition, it may be helpful to look into the logs for the [scheduler](https://github.com/Azure/fleet/blob/main/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go) to get more information on why the scheduling failed.

### Common scenarios:

Instances where this condition may arise:

- When the placement policy is set to `PickFixed`, but the specified cluster names do not match any joined member cluster name in the fleet, or the specified cluster is no longer connected to the fleet.
- When the placement policy is set to `PickN`, and N clusters are specified, but there are fewer than N clusters that have joined the fleet or satisfy the placement policy.
- When the CRP resource selector selects a reserved namespace.

>Note: When the placement policy is set to `PickAll`, the `ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled` condition is always set to `true`.

### Example Scenario:

The example output below demonstrates a `ClusterResourcePlacement` with a `PickN` placement policy attempting to propagate resources to two clusters labeled `env:prod`. In this instance, two clusters, namely `kind-cluster-1` and `kind-cluster-2`, are joined to the fleet, with only one member cluster, `kind-cluster-1`, having the label `env:prod`.

```

The `ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled` condition is set to `false`, the goal is to select two clusters with the label `env:prod`, but only one member cluster possesses the correct label as specified in `clusterAffinity`.

We can also take a look at the `ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot` status to figure out why the scheduler could not schedule the resource for the placement policy specified.

The corresponding `ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot` spec and status gives us even more information on why scheduling failed. Please refer to this [section](#how-to-find--verify-the-latest-clusterschedulingpolicysnapshot-for-a-crp) to learn how to get the latest `ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot`.

### Resolution:
The solution here is to add the `env:prod` label to the member cluster resource for `kind-cluster-2` as well, so that the scheduler can select the cluster to propagate resources.
