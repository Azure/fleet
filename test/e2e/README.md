# Fleet E2E Tests (API version v1beta1)

This directory includes the E2E test suites for Fleet agents (v1beta1 API). To run the 
test suites, follow the steps below:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

2. Change to the current directory, and run `setup.sh` to set up the test environment.

    ```sh
    cd ./test/e2e
    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    
    # Use a different path if the local set up is different.
    export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
    export OUTPUT_TYPE=type=docker
    ./setup.sh
    ```

    The setup script will perform the following tasks:

    * Provision a number of `Kind` clusters: `hub` as the hub cluster, with `bravelion`, `smartfish`
      and `singingbutterfly` as the member clusters
    * Build the agent images
    * Upload the images to the `Kind` clusters
    * Install the agent images

3. Run the command below to start running the tests:

    ```sh
    go test .
    ```

## Access the `Kind` clusters

To access the `Kind` clusters, after the test environment is set up using `setup.sh`, switch
between the following contexts using the command `kubectl config use-context`:

* `kind-hub` for accessing the hub cluster
* `kind-cluster-1` for accessing the first cluster
* `kind-cluster-2` for accessing the second cluster
* `kind-cluster-3` for accessing the third cluster

Fleet agents run in the namespace `fleet-system`; to retrieve their logs, switch to a `Kind`
cluster, and run the following steps:

1. Find out the name of the pod with the command:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n fleet-system
    ```

    You should see the agent pod in the output list; write down the name of the pod.

2. Retrieve the logs:

    ```sh
    # Replace YOUR-POD-NAME with a value of your own.
    kubectl logs YOUR-POD-NAME -n fleet-system
    ```

## Tear down the test environment.

To stop the `Kind` clusters, run the script `stop.sh`:

    ```sh
    chmod +x ./stop.sh
    ./stop.sh
    ```
